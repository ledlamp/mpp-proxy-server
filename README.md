Just a [`node-http-proxy` server with websocket support](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy#proxying-websockets), [targeting Multiplayer Piano's websocket server](index.js). The previous version was made using a [`ws`](https://github.com/websockets/ws) server that created a `ws` client for each connection. It has been renamed to [`websocket-proxy`](https://github.com/ledlamp/websocket-proxy) and now supports custom targets and HTTP headers based on URL query parameters. Then this was re-created much more simply using `node-http-proxy` instead. Useful if you just want an MPP proxy on Heroku, OpenShift, etc.
